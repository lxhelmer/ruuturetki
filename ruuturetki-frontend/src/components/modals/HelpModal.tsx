          This is a simple game with 5 rounds.
          </h5>
          On each round you are shown a random spot around Helsinki.
          Your task is is to select the matching spot on the picker map. 
          The maximum score per round is 10 000 which is decreased based
          on the amount you miss the mark and the amount you move away
          from the starting position.
          Ideally you would select the right position within a meter while not moving at all.
          You can skip a round, but forfit points from that round.
