# Ruuturetki

App up for now at render: https://ruuturetki.onrender.com

Using the backend hosted on https://ruuturetki-backend.onrender.com

This is a map game I made as the submission for University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open Course project.

## User facing functionality
-  The game implements game where the player tries to guess the location of orthophotograph presented. The positions are random within the scope of the borders of the map.
-  The user has the ability to move around slightly, but no zoom or any kind of maplegend on the orthophoto.
-  The score is calculated based on the movement during guess and the final guess distance.
-  After each round the location of the guess relative to the answer is shown.
-  Guess is done by selecting a position on a secondary map.
-  There are five rounds per game and the user has the ability to skip a round forfiting any potential points from that round.
-  Maximum score for the round is 9998 with maximal game score 4990 but these limits are presented in the game as 10000 and 50 000.
-  Game can be played in either guest mode or with a useraccount.
-  New account can be registered in the interface.
-  When playing with useraccount games with non-zero final score are stored to the scoreboard.
-  There are two kinds of users, reqular and admin. Admin has the added ability of removing score entries from the scoreboard and access to development statistics during gameplay
-  There is no way to add admin user account in the frontend as security measure. The change needs to be done in the database.

## Details of technical implementation

The app consists of vite - react - ts frontend and ts-node backend
As the application is hosted on the free tier of Render.com both take a secod to ramp up. The user is notified of this in the login and register modals, but at first even the start page will be unreachable.

### Frontend
-  Frontend runs in a container with environment variables passed on Render as secret file
-  The frontend uses multiple leaflet map instances.
-  Orthoimaginery is loaded online from City of Helsinkis wms-server. More information of this service at [helsingin-ortoilmakuvat](https://hri.fi/data/fi/dataset/helsingin-ortoilmakuvat)
-  The fronend communicates via token authenticated axios requests with the backend.
-  As interesting implementation details, the scoreboard is implemented as mui-datagrid which handles the sorting and rendering of data quite nicely but was finnicy to get working properly.

### Backend

- Backend runs with ts-node, although the memory usage is higher than with transpiled js/node code, there were some major conflicts with transpiling which were outside the reach of the project for the moment.
- Backend works as a bridge to a MongoDB database validating request using zod and ts interfaces.
- Interesting implementation detail is that environment variables are handled with [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) package which handles the zod validation for environment variables.

## Futher development

- Different gamemodes with older ortholayers and prepicked positions. 'Daily' mode and a admin picker tool for such would be nice.
- General improvement of the codebase. Better implementation of the routers e.g. handlind the checking of authentication in separate middleware.
- Bring back testing, during the development of backend vitest was used to make sure that the backend functioned correctly, but these tests later became deprecated because of transpiling conflicts
